        <h2>Class Information</h2>
        <p>The Materials and Processes course offers a comprehensive exploration of the materials, manufacturing processes, and design techniques essential for creating products aimed at mass and rapid production. The curriculum emphasizes understanding the impact of diverse materials and processes on the industrial design workflow. Students will examine the mechanical and physical properties of various materials and their implications for manufacturing processes, equipment, environmental concerns, and end-user requirements. The course aims to provide practical insights into material selection, application strategies, and process specification, focusing on practical rather than theoretical aspects of materials science. This hands-on approach ensures that students are well-prepared to make informed decisions in real-world industrial design projects. </p>
        <h2>Professor Information</h2>

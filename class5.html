        <h2>Class Information</h2>
        <p>The Topics in Design Competencies course provides an immersive introduction to digital fabrication, focusing on CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining and laser cutting techniques. Students explore the entire digital fabrication process, from design to execution, learning to integrate tools like Fusion 360 for CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing). The curriculum emphasizes the strategic selection and application of digital tools, considering their specific advantages and limitations. Through practical, hands-on projects, students develop proficiency in operating CNC machines and begin to understand laser cutting, enhancing their ability to infuse creativity into their digital designs. This course equips students with foundational skills in modern manufacturing processes, preparing them for advanced applications in design and production. </p>
        <h2>Professor Information</h2>

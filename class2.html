        <h2>Class Information</h2>
        <p>Ethnic American Literature dives into a rich collection of 20th and 21st-century literary texts by Native American and US authors of color. The course aims to deepen understanding of how these texts reflect and contest societal constructs around race, gender, and other identities within American literature. By exploring the concept of racial capitalism, students will connect diverse historical and social themes—such as nationalism and displacement—to enhance their interpretive skills. The course engages with challenging content, including strong language and graphic imagery, using these elements as opportunities for thoughtful discussion and personal reflection on the complexities of multi-ethnic literature.</p>
        <h2>Professor Information</h2>
        <p>Dr. S. Moon Cassinelli is an Assistant Professor in the Department of English at Virginia Tech, where he teaches courses related to Asian American studies, Ethnic American literatures, and gender and women’s studies. His academic background includes a focus on queer and feminist theories, particularly analyzing the formation of families within contemporary Korean American narratives.

Dr. Cassinelli has contributed to the academic community through publications, including an article in Women’s Studies Quarterly, where he explored queer kinships in Nora Okja Keller’s mother-daughter narratives. This work exemplifies his interest in the intersections of race, gender, and sexuality within literary studies.</p>

        <h2>Class Information</h2>
        <p>The Technical Editing and Style course offers a comprehensive approach to editing written documents, focusing on both the micro and macro aspects of text refinement. Starting with basic copyediting skills—grammar mechanics, punctuation, and spelling—the course progresses to comprehensive editing, which includes improving content, organization, and visual design. Throughout the semester, students engage in daily editing exercises, complete three major editing projects, and take two exams. The course culminates in the creation of a professional portfolio of editing samples, which serves as a practical tool for pursuing careers in editing or professional writing. Additionally, the course addresses the ethical considerations and responsibilities inherent in the role of an editor, ensuring students are prepared for the complexities of editorial work.
